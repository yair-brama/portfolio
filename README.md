## Data Visualization Projects
### Data-Driven Airfares Analysis

[View airfares analysis](https://yair-brama-airfares.onrender.com/)

I created a dashboard for visualizing the volatility and trending of airfares prices as they are observed over 2 months. The user can choose the market (e.g. BOSRIC - Boston to Richmond), the departure date and then select a specific flight number. In addition, he/she can filter by volatility level (low, mid or high) or the trend of the prices (positive, negative). If there is more than one flight (e.g. the 5 flights from Boston to Richmond on May 5 that their price is going down) then the plot will show the average price over the observation time period.

### Car Prices Analysis - A Kaggle dataset

The "Vehicle Sales and Market Trends Dataset" provides a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to the sales transactions of various vehicles. This dataset encompasses details such as the make, model, body type, transmission type, state of registration, condition rating, odometer reading, exterior and interior colors, seller information, Manheim Market Report (MMR) values, selling prices, and sale dates.
In my analysis I performed a data cleanup and normalization, handling missing values by removing some records or completing it by making calculations.
